## Files

- `models.ini`: ASCII art models, heavily based (almost copied ^^) from @schachmat/wego. It is in french but can be translated without effort.
- `parameters.ini`: Forecast.io parameters, you will have to use your own values here.
- `requirements.txt`: required modules to install.
- `weather.py`: the actual Python code that will do the work.

## Requirements

A free account on [Forecast.io](https://forecast.io) is requires to get an API key.
